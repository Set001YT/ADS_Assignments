Hello! My name is Asset Iglikov, I am a student of AITU, group SE-2434. If you are reading this, it means that I provided a link to this repository. 
Here is an instruction about downloading and run files:
How to download and run files?
1.Click on src/assignment name and then on the name of the file you want to run.
2.If you want to download, click on the "download" button (download icon)
3.After downloading the file, click on it and run it through the IDE (in my case it is IntelliJ IDEA)
4.Enter the data and the code will give the result
5.Also you can also check the file code itself and there will also be comments inside it. They contain information about what is used in the code and what is responsible for what.
I hope this guide will help you understand the files and their contents. Have a nice day!
